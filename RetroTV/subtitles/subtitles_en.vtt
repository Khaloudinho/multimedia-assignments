00:00:15.014 --> 00:00:17.213
The club isn't the best place to find a lover

1
00:00:17.403 --> 00:00:19.902
So the bar is where I go

2
00:00:20.108 --> 00:00:22.207
Me and my friends at the table doing shots

3
00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:24.818
Drinking fast and then we talk slow

4
00:00:25.014 --> 00:00:27.413
You come over and start up a conversation with just me

5
00:00:27.607 --> 00:00:29.806
And trust me I'll give it a chance now

6
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:31.009
Take my hand stop

7
00:00:31.313 --> 00:00:32.212
Put Van The Man on the jukebox

8
00:00:32.414 --> 00:00:34.113
And then we start to dance

9
00:00:34.317 --> 00:00:35.316
And now I'm singing like

10
00:00:35.214 --> 00:00:37.613
Girl you know I want your love

11
00:00:37.813 --> 00:00:40.512
Your love was handmade for somebody like me

12
00:00:40.706 --> 00:00:42.205
Come on now follow my lead

13
00:00:42.305 --> 00:00:44.704
I may be crazy don't mind me

14
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.299
Say boy let's not talk too much

15
00:00:47.503 --> 00:00:50.402
Grab on my waist and put that body on me

16
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.199
Come on now follow my lead

17
00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:56.108
Come come on now follow my lead

18
00:00:56.314 --> 00:00:58.413
I'm in love with the shape of you

19
00:00:58.615 --> 00:01:00.814
We push and pull like a magnet do

20
00:01:01.006 --> 00:01:03.305
Although my heart is falling too

21
00:01:03.507 --> 00:01:05.906
I'm in love with your body

22
00:01:06.104 --> 00:01:08.303
And last night you were in my room

23
00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:10.608
And now my bedsheets smell like you

24
00:01:10.812 --> 00:01:13.211
Every day discovering something brand new

25
00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.208
I'm in love with your body

26
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.199

I'm in love with the shape of you

34
00:01:35.414 --> 00:01:36.913
One week in we let the story begin

35
00:01:37.105 --> 00:01:39.604
We're going out on our first date

36
00:01:39.918 --> 00:01:41.017
You and me are thrifty

37
00:01:41.217 --> 00:01:42.216
So go all you can eat

38
00:01:42.316 --> 00:01:44.715
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate

39
00:01:44.903 --> 00:01:47.300
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour

40
00:01:47.508 --> 00:01:49.707
And how your family is doing okay

41
00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.408
Leave and get in a taxi then kiss in the backseat

42
00:01:52.558 --> 00:01:54.217
Tell the driver make the radio play

43
00:01:54.403 --> 00:01:55.402
And I'm singing like

44
00:01:55.616 --> 00:01:57.315

00:01:57.511 --> 00:02:00.410
